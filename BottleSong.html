      <h3>Do you remember that classic schoolbus song?  Why were kids singing about beer bottles anyway?!?  Well, now you dont have to do all the work of singing each line.  Just tell us how many bottles you want to start with and we'll do the rest for you.  And with all that time freed up, you can actually go take down a bottle and enjoy a cold one.</h3>
